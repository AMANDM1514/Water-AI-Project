Project Overview:

The Water Conservation Advisor is an interactive web application designed to provide users with tips and advice on how to save water effectively. It utilizes a combination of machine learning (ML) and data visualization techniques to generate informative responses based on user queries. The application employs the GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to provide intelligent responses and visualizes relevant data using graphs created with Matplotlib.

Project Components
Excel Data Source:

The project uses an Excel sheet (water_conservation_data.xlsx) that contains information related to various water conservation tips, including their descriptions and corresponding values (like counts or effectiveness).
Streamlit Framework:

Streamlit is a powerful tool for building interactive web applications in Python. It allows for the easy deployment of ML models and data visualizations.
GPT-2 Language Model:

GPT-2 is a pre-trained transformer model capable of generating human-like text. It responds to user queries about water conservation tips.
Matplotlib for Visualization:

Matplotlib is a plotting library used to create visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts based on user inputs.
Detailed Code Explanation
Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the code used in the water_conservation_advisor.py script:


import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import torch
Imports:
pandas: For handling and analyzing data from Excel.
streamlit: For building the web application interface.
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating visualizations (e.g., bar charts).
transformers: To load the GPT-2 model for generating responses.
torch: Used for tensor operations required by PyTorch (the backend for Transformers).

python-code

# Load the Excel data from the local path
data = pd.read_excel(r'C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\WATER AI PROJECT\water_conservation_data.xlsx')
Load Data:
The code reads the Excel file containing water conservation tips into a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for easy data manipulation and visualization.

python-code:

# Load the GPT-2 model and tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
Load GPT-2 Model:
The tokenizer and model for GPT-2 are loaded from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The tokenizer converts input text into a format suitable for the model, and the model itself is used to generate text responses.


# Streamlit App Title and Description
st.title("Water Conservation Advisor")
st.write("Welcome to the Water Conservation Advisor! Ask me for tips on saving water.")
Streamlit Interface:
The title and introductory text are displayed in the Streamlit application, creating a user-friendly interface.


# User Input
user_input = st.text_input("Enter your question or request for water-saving tips:")
Input Box:
A text input box allows users to enter their questions or requests regarding water conservation.

def get_tips(input_text):
    # Encode the input text
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
    
    # Generate response
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
    
    # Decode the generated text
    response = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response

Function to Get Tips:
get_tips(input_text): This function takes the user's input, encodes it into tensor format, and passes it to the GPT-2 model to generate a response. The response is decoded back into human-readable text.

if st.button("Get Tips"):
    if user_input:
        tips = get_tips(user_input)
        st.write(tips)

Button to Get Tips:
When the "Get Tips" button is clicked, the application checks if there is user input and calls the get_tips function to generate and display tips.

# Data visualization based on user input
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(data['Tip'], data['Count'])  # Assuming 'Tip' and 'Count' are columns in your Excel
plt.title("Water Conservation Tips")
plt.xlabel("Tips")
plt.ylabel("Count")
st.pyplot(fig)

Visualization:
A bar chart is created using Matplotlib to visualize the tips from the Excel data. This chart is displayed in the Streamlit app. Here, it is assumed that the Excel file has columns labeled Tip and Count.

Conclusion:
The Water Conservation Advisor project effectively combines data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques to educate users about water-saving practices. By utilizing Streamlit for the user interface, GPT-2 for generating intelligent responses, and Matplotlib for visualizations, the application offers an engaging way for users to learn about water conservation.

This project can be expanded further by integrating more sophisticated models or enhancing the data visualization aspects. The use of a well-structured Excel file allows for easy updates and additions of new tips and data, ensuring that the application remains relevant and useful.
